## Inspiration
We wanted to irritate a certain someone.

## What it does
It downloads beautiful cat photos whenever you visit a webpage, and once you visit a webpage, it wouldn't allow you to go back.

## How we built it
We created a chrome extension using JavaScript

## How you can build it
This extension works only on chrome
- Download the source and unzip it
- Go to Manage Extensions page in Chrome
- Enable Developer options
- Select Load Unpacked and select the source folder
- Enjoy

## Challenges we ran into
- The photos failed to download :(
- Publishing to chrome webstore due to lack of money T_T

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully annoyed "the certain someone" (and ourselves too xD)

## What we learned
- Building chrome extension

## What's next for Cat-Trapped
- Overcoming the challenges to make it little more practically impractical
- Publishing to the webstore
- Extending it to Firefox
